# DonorsChoose Project Proposal Prediction

## Overview

DonorsChoose.org receives hundreds of thousands of project proposals each year for classroom projects in need of funding. Currently, a large number of volunteers is needed to manually screen each submission before itâ€™s approved to be posted on the DonorsChoose.org website. Next year, DonorsChoose.org expects to receive close to 500,000 project proposals. This project aims to address the following challenges:

- How to scale current manual processes and resources to screen 500,000 projects.
- How to increase the consistency of project vetting across different volunteers.
- How to focus volunteer time on the applications that need the most assistance.

The goal of the competition is to predict whether or not a DonorsChoose.org project proposal submitted by a teacher will be approved, using the text of project descriptions as well as additional metadata about the project, teacher, and school.

## Type of Model Used
- LSTM

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gathered data on project descriptions, teacher, and school metadata. Preprocessed the text data to prepare it for model training.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracted relevant features from the text descriptions using techniques such as CountVectorizer.
3. **Model Training**: Trained various machine learning models to predict whether a project proposal will be approved.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the models using the AUC (Area Under the Curve) metric to determine their performance.

| S.NO. | Architecture                    | Test AUC |
|-------|---------------------------------|----------|
| 1     | Model 1                         | 0.7607   |
| 2     | Model 2                         | 0.7149   |
| 3     | Model 3 without CountVectorizer | 0.7634   |
| 4     | Model 3 with CountVectorizer    | 0.7663   |

## Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict the approval of DonorsChoose.org project proposals. By leveraging different models and feature engineering techniques, we achieved a test AUC score of up to 0.7663. These models can help in scaling the screening process, increasi
